<!-- READ ME!!
You will probably be getting an error in this file for the line
containing "@string/maps_api_key.  This is intentional.  Every
computer must have a different Google Maps API key.  If you want
to use the map features of the app, you must get an API key yourself.
Go to https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/mapkey
and follow the instructions there.  You will want to use the debug
API key.

NOTE:  If you can't figure out how to get an API key, then until you
can work with me, just put some bogus value for the API key as
described below.  This will allow the build to work, but you will
not be able to use the Map tab on the app.

When you get an API key, put it in a separate file in the values folder
as a string resource.  You will need to create a new file to do this.
Name the file maps_api_key.xml.  When you make this new file, make a new string
resource called maps_api_key and put
your API key as the value.  DO NOT COMMIT THIS NEW FILE TO THE GIT
REPOSITORY!  If you do, then you will break everyone else's build.
If you correctly named the file as "maps_api_key.xml" then this
should not be an issue as it should already be in the .gitignore file.


Thanks for reading,
